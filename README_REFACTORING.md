# ApolloAgent Refactoring

## Overview

The ApolloAgent codebase has been refactored to split the monolithic `agent.py` file into multiple modules within a package structure. This refactoring follows Python best practices and makes the codebase more maintainable.

## Changes Made

1. Created a new package structure:
   - `apollo_agent/` - Main package directory
   - `apollo_agent/__init__.py` - Package initialization, re-exports ApolloAgent
   - `apollo_agent/agent.py` - Main ApolloAgent class with method stubs
   - `apollo_agent/file_operations.py` - File operation functions
   - `apollo_agent/search_operations.py` - Search operation functions
   - `apollo_agent/chat_operations.py` - Chat operation functions

2. Maintained backward compatibility:
   - The original `agent.py` file now imports and re-exports the ApolloAgent class from the new package
   - Existing code that imports ApolloAgent from agent.py will continue to work without changes

3. Tested the refactored code:
   - Created test scripts to verify that the refactored code works as expected
   - Verified that backward compatibility is maintained

## Manual Update Instructions

If you encounter any issues with the automatic update of `agent.py`, you can manually update it with the following content:

```python
"""
ApolloAgent is a custom AI agent that implements various functions for code assistance.
Author: Alberto Barrago
License: MIT - 2025

This file provides backward compatibility for existing code that imports ApolloAgent from here.
The actual implementation has been moved to the apollo_agent package.
"""

# Re-export ApolloAgent from the new package
from apollo_agent import ApolloAgent

# For backward compatibility, keep the original imports
import asyncio
import os

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(ApolloAgent.chat_terminal())
```

## Testing

Two test scripts have been created to verify the refactoring:

1. `test_refactored.py` - Tests the functionality of the refactored code
2. `test_backward_compatibility.py` - Tests that backward compatibility is maintained

Run these scripts to verify that the refactoring was successful:

```bash
python test_refactored.py
python test_backward_compatibility.py
```

## Next Steps

1. Review the refactored code to ensure it meets your requirements
2. Consider adding more comprehensive tests
3. Update documentation to reflect the new package structure
